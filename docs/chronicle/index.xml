&lt;p>Every year around the holidays, our community comes together to support a cause close to our hearts, the Sternenbrücke from Hamburg. The children&amp;rsquo;s hospice Sternenbrücke provides respite care for terminally ill children and affected families. Even after the loss of the child, the Sternenbrücke continues to support the families in their grief.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We have been supporting the Sternenbrücke since 2016.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Formula Student is the biggest university engineering competition in the world. In the 1980s the project originated as an educational concept with the goal to nurture engineering talent. It evolved from being a Society of Automotive Engineers’ student competition to being an international contest with diverse teams of universities from all over the world participating. Formula Student Portugal is a new event for the Formula Student community in Portugal.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title/><link>https://freiheit.com/chronicle/2024-11-19-how-do-we-use-ai/</link><pubDate>Tue, 19 Nov 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://freiheit.com/chronicle/2024-11-19-how-do-we-use-ai/</guid><description>&lt;p>As software engineers, we at freiheit.com aim to ensure everyone “knows what the company knows,” sharing 25+ years of expertise across our teams and clients. Our lean Request for Comments process keeps our Knowledge Base up to date, with thousands of articles added. To make knowledge easier to access, we’ve implemented AI using Google Cloud, allowing teams to find the right information at the right time.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Knowledge sharing is key for us at freiheit.com as we tackle complex, large-scale software projects.

How are we successfully delivering large-scale projects to our clients always on time, on budget, on target and on quality?  To deliver the right product, we need to understand the client’s needs, establish the project scope and define the right features. We always ensure that we maintain uniformity and simplicity within the code base throughout the project.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Who is responsible for that?

Instead, performance also builds on hidden qualities that tell us how we show up when things get hard, in situations of stress, challenge or uncertainty. We call them Attributes. They are inherent to our nature and therefore harder but not impossible to develop. We’ve created a video series about them.

In 2018, we opened a second engineering hub in Lisbon.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>freiheit.com has always been for engineers by engineers, so to organize this big step, Claudia didn’t want to hire managers but chose freiheit.com engineers who embody our values and who would be able to transport them to a new hub. This is not easy – suddenly, these engineers had to take on a new role and build up a new engineering hub from scratch. And they did it!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title/><link>https://freiheit.com/chronicle/2024-10-16-lisbon-summer-event-2024/</link><pubDate>Wed, 16 Oct 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://freiheit.com/chronicle/2024-10-16-lisbon-summer-event-2024/</guid><description>&lt;p>September was special for our Lisbon engineering hub — it was our first-ever beach Summer Event. We had an amazing time surfing, playing beach volleyball and having great talks about technology and engineering.&lt;br>
It was all about having good discussions, lots of fun and creating new memories.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Our Lisbon hub has come a long way since its start in 2018 when our&lt;br>
co-founder Claudia Dietze made her dream come true by opening a second hub for freiheit.com technologies.&lt;br>
From the start, it was important to grow the hub with the same engineering spirit as in Hamburg — built for engineers by engineers.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title/><link>https://freiheit.com/chronicle/2024-10-02-the-freiheit-com-kudos-system/</link><pubDate>Wed, 02 Oct 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://freiheit.com/chronicle/2024-10-02-the-freiheit-com-kudos-system/</guid><description>&lt;p>Why are we successful?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There is one thing that brings us all together. The willingness to tackle new and interesting problems all the time. And successfully delivering them.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Becoming a well-rounded software engineer is a long journey that takes many years of hard work and learning.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When starting at freiheit.com, you are responsible for the smallest scope of work. From that on you gather experiences, learn from it and prove that you can reliably and independently handle the responsibilities of a certain level.&lt;br>
When we put together a team, we need different skill levels.&lt;br>
Our members pass through many different levels, from starting as a newbie, becoming a team lead and eventually being in charge of multiple teams.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title/><link>https://freiheit.com/chronicle/2024-08-07-california-night-2024/</link><pubDate>Wed, 07 Aug 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://freiheit.com/chronicle/2024-08-07-california-night-2024/</guid><description>&lt;div id="youtube_cLcasJULjls_container" class="relative h-0 my-12">

&lt;h3 id="lisbon-was-a-natural-choice">Lisbon was a natural choice&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Claudia revealed how they proceeded. Before leaving Germany, they investigated which places had the best universities and selected three cities: Barcelona, Madrid and Lisbon: «During four weeks, we travelled, we worked in coworking spaces, we had meetings with the founders of other companies and withthe chambers of commerce». The choice was «easy» because it became obvious that Barcelona «was not the right location since most people there are foreigners». With view to Madrid, the situation was different. However, the city was «not open enough for international business». Lisbon «was a pleasant surprise. Everybody was enthusiastic about our idea of opening an office here and wanted to help us with the first steps». In addition to this, two of the main clients had teams or development centres in Lisbon: Daimler (through Mercedes) and Volkswagen. Until the end of the year, the company will «hire fifty new professionals». However, it is essential for freitheit.com to find people with «the right skills and the right attitude», in other words «they have to be curious and not afraid of being pioneers», emphasised the executive. From Germany, freiheit.com has brought four engineers because the objective was not to open a subsidiary «but to open an office at eye level with Hamburg, with the same culture and with the best engineers».&lt;/p></description></item><item><title/><link>https://freiheit.com/chronicle/2018-10-16-code.talks-2018/</link><pubDate>Tue, 16 Oct 2018 16:38:23 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://freiheit.com/chronicle/2018-10-16-code.talks-2018/</guid><description>Some people think, that managers are not needed anymore.

On May 9, 2016, we will start off the Meetup with parser combinators in Haskell. Alex Biehl is going to present the basic concept and use of parser combinators and interactively build a JSON parser and develop a personal parser combinators library on the beamer. Parsers are used almost everywhere: HTML pages in browsers, JSON, or other small, self-defined format, which need to be assembled logically for processing, in order to be mapped onto data structures. Should a library - that gets the job done - not exist, the developer must build a parser manually. The effort to use established tools such as Yacc or ANTLR is fairly high, which is why it is sometimes obvious to use the quick and dirty solution via string operation and/or standard term. In short, both comprehensibility and maintainability suffer immensely. Parser combinators are a great answer: They allow construction of complicated parsers through the combination of small, simple parsers.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title/><link>https://freiheit.com/chronicle/2016-04-19-codetalks_april_2016/</link><pubDate>Tue, 19 Apr 2016 18:57:33 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://freiheit.com/chronicle/2016-04-19-codetalks_april_2016/</guid><description>&lt;p>Thomas Storck - CIO METRO Cash &amp;amp; Carry - knows the necessity of the digital transformation.
