      <description>&lt;p&gt;We helped cosnova bring best-in-class user experience to their customers by rebuilding the two webshops for their brands Catrice and essence, delivering on a tight deadline. The webpages were rolled out in over 80 countries worldwide and provide high performance using the Next JS framework. The page scored &amp;ldquo;green&amp;rdquo; on Google&amp;rsquo;s Lighthouse test, indicating low page load times and a short time to be interactive for the page’s users. We rebuilt the UI Component Library using React and (S)CSS to optimize the user experience on both webshops across multiple devices. Additionally, we connected a headless e-commerce system through go microservices. Our iterative approach allowed for a fast ready-to-market release with a significantly improved user experience.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;For the food giant METRO we have built a large-scale e-commerce platform and rolled it out to 20+ countries. After just under five years, the system now generates over 4 billion euros per year and has become one of the largest &lt;a class=&#34;font-serif no-underline hover:text-red&#34; href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/customers/metro&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Google Cloud&amp;nbsp;→&lt;/a&gt; customers in Europe.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Cloud-Based Mobile Inventory Management for EDEKA</title>
      <link>https://mploigt.github.io/freiheit/things-weve-built/cloud-based-mobile-inventory-management-for-edeka/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Over 30 months, four teams developed a flutter-based solution connected to an Azure backend in the cloud, that is currently used by more than 200 stores of EDEKA – the largest German supermarket corporation. More retail stores from the EDEKA group are to follow.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Together with EDEKA DIGITAL, the IT subsidiary of EDEKA headquarters, we designed and implemented a new mobile inventory management solution (Warenwirtschaftssystem) to support all processes in their supermarkets. Our mission was to replace the outdated offline-only version developed by a third party. Daily deployments enable the teams to rapidly implement user feedback. The improved user experience simplified the daily work of thousands of EDEKA employees using the new solution. All milestones of this 30-months project were reached on time and on budget, and future extensions/adaptations of the software can be easily implemented by EDEKA.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;With one of the world’s largest manufacturers of professional dental products and technologies, we have built a cloud ecosystem that lets dentists collect and process 3D image data in the cloud right from their scanning device. The service enables real-time cloud collaboration between specialists and ordering 3D printed oral appliances with strict GDPR compliance. This first-of-its-kind solution not only gives our client a competitive advantage, but also streamlines healthcare services for millions of patients around the globe. &lt;a class=&#34;font-serif no-underline hover:text-red&#34; href=&#34;https://mploigt.github.io/freiheit/chronicle/2024-04-08-case-study-dentsply-sirona/&#34;&gt;Read Case Study&amp;nbsp;→&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Using Machine Learning Algorithms to Fulfill Physical Order Slips for BA.Unternehmensgruppe</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;To relieve workload from skilled professionals, our engineers set out to make the processing of physical order slips 10x more efficient. They built a system that processes complex image data to extract and categorize information using machine learning algorithms. This significantly reduced workload from specialists and freed up time for more demanding tasks.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We have been working with German car manufactures, building cloud back-ends and head unit integration for new cars coming out over the next few years. Our music streaming, mobile office and notification applications are currently running in production in data centers around the world. Also we have built a new core app (and its cloud back-ends), which is the main app for all new owners of the recently launched electric cars. We love using Flutter and Dart!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Building the Backbone of Tchibo’s digital Business</title>
      <link>https://mploigt.github.io/freiheit/things-weve-built/hyper-scalable-e-commerce-system/</link>

      <guid>https://mploigt.github.io/freiheit/things-weve-built/hyper-scalable-e-commerce-system/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In 2009 we built a new custom webshop for Tchibo, a leading coffee and consumer goods retailer in Europe with an annual turnover of €3 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“Jede Woche eine neue Welt” – Tchibo’s unique concept required a webshop as dynamic as their vision. Their former standardized webshop solution couldn’t keep up with growing webshop sales at that time. So we rebuilt their whole system from scratch.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We committed the Go-Live date for the new webshop twelve months in advance – and delivered as planned and on time, on budget, on target.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We started to build our own site reliability engineering team in 2016. If you are interested in learning how to plan, automate, observe and scale large platforms, you should check out our SRE group!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Building the future of Omnichannel Retail Platforms</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;freiheit.com enabled Peek &amp;amp; Cloppenburg Düsseldorf to create a seamless omnichannel platform using &lt;a class=&#34;font-serif no-underline hover:text-red&#34; href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/customers/peek-cloppenburg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Google Cloud&amp;nbsp;→&lt;/a&gt;. With 160 stores in 16 countries and multiple international online shops, Peek &amp;amp; Cloppenburg Düsseldorf fashion group sells high-grade fashion for all ages. Together with P&amp;amp;C, we built a scalable system for personalized shopping experiences based on customer interests and purchase history. The retail platform drives sales performance by connecting online and in-store shopping experiences.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;To ensure that Peek &amp;amp; Cloppenburg Düsseldorf can seamlessly take over once the platform is live and operational, we supported the omnichannel project with several teams, from our lead engineering team that&amp;rsquo;s doing most of the development, to integrated teams that include engineers from both organizations.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Flight Booking Engines</title>

      <guid>https://mploigt.github.io/freiheit/things-weve-built/flight-booking-engines/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Way back in 1999, we were among the first to build travel and booking systems that connected the giant computer reservation systems (CRS) of Amadeus and Sabre to the internet. We were the first to show only the available flights, filtering out unhelpful unavailable flights, long before sites like Expedia even existed.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Online Bookstores</title>
      <link>https://mploigt.github.io/freiheit/things-weve-built/online-bookstores/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 12 May 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://mploigt.github.io/freiheit/things-weve-built/online-bookstores/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;We have been building many of the e-commerce platforms for the competitors of Amazon in the German and European book industry. Online bookstores were quite difficult to build in the times before the cloud, because they have staggeringly large assortments, often over 20 million individual articles, which change daily. That’s a lot of data to process! On top of that it is very satisfying to work for the “underdogs” and help them to compete with industry giants like Amazon.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We have built lottery platforms (business model: selling random numbers) and dating platforms (business model: selling contacts between customers). The internet is full of interesting new ideas and we are sure that this is still just the beginning.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
