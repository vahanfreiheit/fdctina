We have been building many of the e-commerce platforms for the competitors of Amazon in the German and European book industry. Online bookstores were quite difficult to build in the times before the cloud, because they have staggeringly large assortments, often over 20 million individual articles, which change daily. That’s a lot of data to process! On top of that it is very satisfying to work for the “underdogs” and help them to compete with industry giants like Amazon.
