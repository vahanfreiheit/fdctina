### Infrastructure modernization from start to end

To understand the client’s requirements and goals and align our ways of working, we set up a series of workshops with our new clients covering:

**- Analysis of current infrastructure**
**- Gathering clients’ infrastructure requirements**
**- Developing Solution Designs**
**- Demonstrating possible solutions**
**- Setting up initial prioritized and estimated backlogs based on MoSCoW method**

Our self built tool Revolution enables the teams to work autonomously and create reproducible results. In Revolution, an engineering team creates structured backlogs and prioritizes on an epic and story level. Those backlogs help the engineering teams to plan their project roadmap more carefully.
Every team has a long-term view of each project and plans based on daily real-time data. Revolution also provides KPIs in real-time about the reliability and progress of a team.

Each challenge of the client is approached individually, but the methodology is the same. As shown in the figure below, our teams work iteration driven in an agile way.

To make sure client requirements and constraints are regularly evaluated and impediments mitigated, the complete prioritization of the backlog is carried out by the Product Owner of the client’s organization. All technologies are selected based on technical design requirements together with the Product Owner.

Automated tests and SRE best practices enable the teams to move quickly and to roll out any change to live directly. KPIs such as SLI, SLO, and error budgets allow the teams to prioritize quality over quantity.

Our methodology and ways of working are a result of many successful infrastructure projects carried out on the Google Cloud Platform.

Using the Google Cloud Platform products, such as Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE), Cloud Storage we successfully migrated many of our clients to the cloud. With two of them we have published success stories to which you can find more information below. Many more are to come.
