Becoming a well-rounded software engineer is a long journey that takes years of hard work and learning.

Many of our freiheit.com technologies engineers found their passion for software-engineering when they were young. Our Co-Founder and Head of Engineering Stefan Richter wrote his first computer program in 1983.

That’s why we at freiheit.com technologies think it is important to invest in the future of software-engineering and decided to support We aRe oNe Robotics with a monetary donation.
They are a German non-profit organization dedicated to teaching children between the ages 9-16 about science and technology - and especially about robotics.

Since We aRe oNe Robotics was founded in 2009, they have taken part in numerous competitions like the [First Lego League](https://www.first-lego-league.org/en/) and the [World Robot Olympiad](https://www.worldrobotolympiad.de/) by TECHNIK BEGEISTERT e.V.

We love this.
