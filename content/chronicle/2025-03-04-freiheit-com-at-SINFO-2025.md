We were back at SINFO! And as every year we met a lot of talented, smart engineering students and introduced them to the world of software engineering.

In February, the annual technology conference SINFO took place at the Técnico Innovation Center (TIC) in Lisbon, Portugal. The event is organized by students for students. We opened our Lisbon engineering hub in 2018. Since then we have been at the SINFO every year to inspire young people to follow their passion in software engineering.

At our booth the students had the chance to learn about how we deliver large-scale software projects and work data-driven in small teams with end-to-end responsibility. The students could talk to their potential future colleagues,

If you didn’t get the chance to meet us there, we regularly host workshops and tech talks on different technologies, coding languages and everything else about software engineering at our Lisbon hub.
Next we will be hosting a Hackerthon! So stay tuned for more!
