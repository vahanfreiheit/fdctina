The almost one thousand year old Speyer Cathedral stands as a testament to the ambitions of many great German emperors and kings. Amongst them Conrad II, Henry IV and Henry V.This long-standing beauty, consecrated in 1061 and known as the largest surviving Romanesque church in the world, was captured by Horst Hamann in 2024.

The German photographer shows us a new perspective of the monument through his characteristic vertical photography style on over 190 pages. His reduction of all colors to black and white forces us to concentrate on the essentials. Many people know him because of his work capturing New York.

Horst Hamann, who grew up in Mannheim, has been impressed by the Romanesque cathedral since childhood. It was a fascinating challenge for him to be able to explore the cathedral extensively in the light of the changing seasons and from many different perspectives.

He himself says:*“It's like a mirage when the cathedral begins to shine in the morning, like the New York skyline over the Hudson River.”*

And: *“Speyer Cathedral fascinates me precisely because it is so simple. It has lines, it has wonderful visual gifts that it constantly reveals, both inside and out.”*

With their permission, Horst Hamann had access to all areas of the Speyer Cathedral for his work at all times, including the attics and all towers.
We believe that cultural monuments like this must be preserved. That is why we have decided to support this project.
