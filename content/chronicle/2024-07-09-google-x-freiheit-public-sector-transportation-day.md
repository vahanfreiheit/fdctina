Google invited us to their Public Sector Transportation Day in Hamburg. Through the use of customer examples, they discussed three topic areas: cyber security and resilience for critical infrastructures, the future of mobility and transportation and how efficiency can be increased through future technologies.

Our freiheit.com team talked about the latter – how we have been delivering large-scale software projects on time, on budget and on target for over a quarter of a century.

When looking at the market, 31% of all software projects fail before completion.
What do we do differently at freiheit.com to successfully deliver every project we start? We use data and metrics to systematically lead software projects to success. Through data-driven software engineering, we significantly increase the delivery reliability of large-scale software projects.

Technology never rests. And neither do we.
