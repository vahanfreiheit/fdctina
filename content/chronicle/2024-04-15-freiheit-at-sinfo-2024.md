Lisbon has a thriving tech scene with many talented engineers, and we are back at SINFO! Since we’re already veterans, we couldn’t miss the chance to be part of it.

Students from Instituto Superior Técnico Lisbon were able to talk to our freiheit.com software engineers with different backgrounds at our booth and learn about how we’ve been delivering large-scale software projects for over a quarter of a century.

This year marked our 6th participation at SINFO, where we talked with numerous talented engineering students from Lisbon, the beautiful city where one of our hubs is situated.

What is SINFO? SINFO is an annual technology conference at the Técnico Innovation Center in Lisbon, Portugal. It’s a place for you to meet us, and therefore potentially your future colleagues at freiheit.com.

If you didn’t get the chance to meet us there and want to join us,
