[Ambrose Bonnaire-Sergeant](https://twitter.com/ambrosebs?lang=de) starts his campaign named [Typed Clojure & clojure.spec: Auto Annotations](https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/typed-clojure-clojure-spec-auto-annotations#/). Write tests, receive types! Type comments in Typed Clojure are large and laborious to write manually.  This project comprises manufacturing of a tool for the automation of the process based on already written tests. freiheit.com is excited to be part of it as a sponsor!
