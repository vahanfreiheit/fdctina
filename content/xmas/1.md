In 2024, our engineers wrote 7,797,336 lines of code, completed 18,923 user stories and made over 62,500 commits. What a year.

As we always say, technology and engineering never rest.

This year, another big engineering milestone was hit. The first successful mid-air catch of the Super Heavy booster was accomplished, marking a breakthrough in rocket reusability and reducing turnaround times for launches. A great step for humanity and the future of space exploration.

Something that seemed impossible not so long ago. Until someone just did it.

That is something we also believe in: Making mission impossible possible.

As we wrap up the year 2024, we remember all we‚Äôve achieved together with you in the last 366 days (leap year).

Take a look ‚Äì our 2024 in numbers! üìπ
