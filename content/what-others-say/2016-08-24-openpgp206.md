On September 8 and September 9, 2016, the German Unix User Group in Cologne organizes the https://gnupg.org/conf/index.html[OpenPGP.conf,role="inline"] - the first public conference with main topic OpenPGP. We are supporters because strong encryption is the most important basic technology of a free and digital future society. freiheit.com is proud to support the conference as silver sponsor.
